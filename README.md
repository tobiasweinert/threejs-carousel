# threejs-carousel

## Description

This project is used to preserve a carousel which I developed while bulding my online portfolio. Since the original repository will be changed alot, I want to keep this state to build something else later on.
Since I also want to keep the live demo for this verison running, I had to create a new repository.

## Features

- **Three.js:** Displays the slides in a carousel that rotates and snaps to the slides.
- **Tween.js:** Smooth animations for different use cases.
- **State Management:** Keeps track of which slide the user is currently viewing.

## Usage

To rotate the carousel and change the visible slide the user can pick one of three methods:

- Drag, rotate and drop the carousel with the mouse
- Use the arrow keys (left/right)
- Use the scroll wheel (up/down)

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://tobiasweinert.github.io/threejs-carousel/).
