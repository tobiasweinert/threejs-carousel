## Description

This website serves as an extension of my curriculum vitae (CV), providing an interactive and dynamic representation of me and my educational journey. It's designed to showcase my skills and experiences in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. Also, I've always wanted to try out Three.js so this was the perfect opportunity to test it out.

## Features
- **Three.js:** Displays the slides in a carousel that rotates and snaps to the slides.
- **Tween.js:** Smooth animations for different use cases.

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://tobiasweinert.github.io/).
